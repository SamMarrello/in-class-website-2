        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Borzoi is a breed of sighthound developed in Russia for the purpose of hunting small game. Despite the original name of “Russian Wolfhound” the main prey of the Borzoi were hare and fox, with only occasional hunts for wolves. The Borzoi was developed via nobles importing sighthounds from other countries, like the Greyhound, or Afghan hound, and then crossing those dogs with native Russian dogs. Originally there were three main branches of dogs that would become the modern Borzoi: a Russian, Ukrainian, and Circassian version. But overtime, they developed into the singular dog breed that we have today. </p>
        <h2>Temperment</h2>
        <p>The Borzoi is a fun-loving dog that loves speed. While they need as much free running time as possible when they’re puppies to promote good muscle development, adult dogs can do well just with regular walks and living in an apartment. When raised around cats and other small animals, a Borzoi will learn to get along with them. However, free roaming strange cats seen outside are at risk of triggering the Borzoi’s prey drive. </p>
        <h2>Health</h2>
        <p>The Borzoi is a largely healthy breed. Degenerative Myelopathy is present in the breed, but now that a simple test has been developed to detect the genetic code of the disease, good breeders have eliminated the disease from their lines. Otherwise, the Borzoi is long lived for a giant breed; most individuals live to around 10-12 years, with exceptionally long-lived ones living to around 14-16 years old. Common illnesses that effect every animal still exist, but can be reduced with health testing before breeding. </p>
        <p class="question">Is a Borzoi right for you? Do you have a:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Yard with a 6 foot fence?</li>
                <li> The budget for food for a 100 pound dog?</li>
                <li>The patience to train a dog with a "what's in it for me?" attitude?
                    <ol>
                        <li>Hounds aren't like herding breeds; they need to be motivated to work</li>
                        <li>While most Borzoi enjoy treats, praise is a huge reward after you develop a relationship with your dog</li>
                        <li>Borzoi are also very sensitive; mild correction when displaying a bad behaviour should be enough, along with structure</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Able to deal with large amounts of shedding?</li>
                <li>Able to deal with a dog that doesn't bark, but is vocal?</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Borzoi Colour</h2>
        <p>Unlike many other breeds, the CKC Borzoi standard doesn't disqualify any colour a Borzoi could be. However, chocolate, blue, and merle colours were never in the breed, and therefore there are no Borzoi in those colours despite being technically allowed</p>
        <p>Please see the table page for a full look at Borzoi colour and pattern combinations!</p>
